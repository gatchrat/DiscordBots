# DetectSteamGame
## What does it do ?
Checks with the Steam API if a certain profile is shown as playing a certain game and then sends a message in a channel, pinging the specified users.
## How to Use
* As a user write "!register" to be added to the list of-to-be-pinged users
* Rename the example settings file and to settings.json
* Set-up the settings file to suit your needs
##  (Possible) Coming Features
* Generalisation of the message system. Allowing every user to define their own message for a distinct profile and game, instead of only allowing one per bot instance.
* Add IDs to messages to allow references
*  Add some kind of message logic. Example: "User A plays game B AND .... OR ... THEN SEND X"
